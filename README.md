# Break Eternity: Rust
My attempt at recreating the [break_eternity.js](https://github.com/Patashu/break_eternity.js) number library in Rust, only by referencing the readme's implementation details.  
If you're looking into using this, don't. Use the crate someone else made instead: https://crates.io/crates/break-eternity
